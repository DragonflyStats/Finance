1 The idea of interest

Interest may be regarded as a reward paid by one person or organisation (the borrower) for the use of an asset, referred to as capital, belonging to another person or organisation (the lender). Capital and interest need to be measured in terms of the same commodity, but when expressed in monetary terms, capital is also referred to as principal.

If there is some risk of default (i.e. loss of capital or non-payment of interest) a lender would expect to be paid a higher rate of interest than would otherwise be the case.
Another factor which may influence the rate of interest on any transaction is an allowance for the possible depreciation or appreciation in the value of the currency in which the transaction is carried out. This factor is obviously very important in times of high inflation. The most elementary concept is that of simple interest. This leads naturally to the idea of compound interest, which is much more commonly found in practice â€” at least in relation to all but short-term investments. Both concepts are easily described within the
framework of a savings account.
