Factor sensitivity

The sensitivity of a portfolio of assets to movements in the underlying risk parameter of an individual asset.


  

Hazard rate model

Economic model used in duration analysis, for example, to determine default probabilities over time. As a dependent variable, the hazard rate portrays the conditional probability that an episode (eg classification under a certain creditworthiness category) will terminate at acertain point in time.


Kappa

A measure of the sensitivity of the price of an option to a change in its implied volatility.


Price Value of a Basis Point - PVBP 
 
A measure used to describe how a basis point change in yield affects the price of a bond.

There is an inverse relationship between bond price and yield. As bond prices decrease, their yields increase and vice versa. The degree of change in bond price per a 1 bps change in yield is determined by a number of other factors, such as the bond's coupon rate, time to maturity, and credit rating.


Duration and convexity are factor sensitivities that describe exposure to parallel shifts in the spot curve. They can be applied to individual fixed income instruments or to entire fixed income portfolios.


Solvency II
The Solvency II Directive 2009/138/EC is an EU Directive that codifies and harmonises the EU insurance regulation. Primarily this concerns the amount of capital that EU insurance companies must hold to reduce the risk of insolvency.

Quanto


Option in one currency, but which pays out in another. Quanto options are usually used in cases when investors are confident of the underlying asset's performance, but are not confident of the performance of the currency which the underlying is denominated in. 


Value-at-Risk 

A value-at-risk (VAR) model is a procedure for estimating the probability of portfolio losses exceeding some specified proportion based on a statistical analysis of historical market price trends, correlations, and volatilities.
