Behavioral economics topics
=================================================
Models in behavioral economics are typically addressed to a particular observed market anomaly and modify standard neo-classical models by describing decision makers as using heuristics and being affected by framing effects. In general, economics sits within the neoclassical framework, though the standard assumption of rational behaviour is often challenged.


### Heuristics
Prospect theory - Loss aversion - Status quo bias - Gambler's fallacy - Self-serving bias - money illusion


### Framing
Cognitive framing - Mental accounting - Anchoring


### Anomalies (economic behavior)
Disposition effect - endowment effect - inequity aversion - reciprocity - intertemporal consumption - present-biased preferences - momentum investing - Greed and fear - Herd instinct - Sunk cost fallacy
 
### Anomalies (market prices and returns)
equity premium puzzle - Efficiency wage hypothesis - price stickiness - limits to arbitrage - dividend puzzle - fat tails - calendar effect
 
## Criticisms of behavioral finance
Critics of behavioral finance, such as Eugene Fama, typically support the efficient market theory (though Fama may have reversed his position in recent years). They contend that behavioral finance is more a collection of anomalies than a true branch of finance and that these anomalies will eventually be priced out of the market or explained by appealing to market microstructure arguments. However, a distinction should be noted between individual biases and social biases; the former can be averaged out by the market, while the other can create feedback loops that drive the market further and further from the equilibrium of the "fair price".
 
A specific example of this criticism is found in some attempted explanations of the ***equity premium puzzle***. It is argued that the puzzle simply arises due to entry barriers (both practical and psychological) which have traditionally impeded entry by individuals into the stock market, and that returns between stocks and bonds should stabilize as electronic resources open up the stock market to a greater number of traders (See Freeman, 2004 for a review). 

In reply, others contend that most personal investment funds are managed through superannuation funds, so the effect of these putative barriers to entry would be minimal. In addition, professional investors and fund managers seem to hold more bonds than one would expect given return differentials.
