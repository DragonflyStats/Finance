 
The Black-Scholes theory, built on the principles of delta-hedging and no arbitrage, has been very successful and fruitful as a theoretical model and in practice. The theory and results are explained using different kinds of mathematics to make the student familiar with techniques in current use.
 
•The Black-Scholes model: A stochastic differential equation for an asset price, the delta-hedged portfolio and self-financing repliction, no arbitrage, the pricing partial differential equation and simple solutions.
•The greeks: delta, gamma, theta, vega and rho and their uses in hedging.
•Risk-neutrality: Fair value of an option as an expectation with respect to a risk-neutral density function.
•Early exercise: American options, elimination of arbitrage, modifying the binomial method, gradient conditions, formulation as a free boundary problem.
•Elementary numerical analysis: Monte Carlo simulation and the explicit finite-difference method.
•Value at Risk: Portfolios of derivatives.
•Martingales: The probabilistic mathematics used in derivatives theory
