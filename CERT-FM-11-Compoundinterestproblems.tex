Analyse elementary compound interest problems.
1. Calculate the present value of payments from a fixed interest security where the coupon rate is constant and the security is redeemed in one instalment.
2. Calculate upper and lower bounds for the present value of a fixed interest security that is redeemable on a single date within a given range at the option of the borrower.
3. Calculate the running yield and the redemption yield from a fixed interest security (as in 1.), given the price.
4. Calculate the present value or yield from an ordinary share and a property, given simple (but not necessarily constant) assumptions about the growth of dividends and rents.
5. Solve an equation of value for the real rate of interest implied by the equation in the presence of specified inflationary growth.
6. Calculate the present value or real yield from an index-linked bond, given assumptions about the rate of inflation.
