Efficient Market Hypothesis
Deﬁnition (Market Eﬃciency, Malkiel, 1992)

A capital market is said to be eﬃcient if it fully and correctly reﬂects all relevant information in determining securities prices. Formally, the market is said to be eﬃcient with respect to some information set, t, if securitiesprices would be unaﬀected by revealing that information to all participants. 
Moreover, eﬃciency with respect to an information set, t, implies that it is impossible to make economic proﬁts by trading on the basis of t.
Both of the above deﬁnitions emphasise that there are three key elements of importance in deﬁning market eﬃciency:

i. The information set: what information are we considering? (This will be discussed further later.)

ii. The ability to exploit the information in a trading strategy: can we use the information to form a successful trading strategy/investment rule?

iii. The performance measure for the trading strategy is economic proﬁts: that is, risk-adjusted (because investors are risk-averse) and net of transaction costs.
