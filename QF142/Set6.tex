E(Y_t)
R^2
Coefficient of determination
Suppose that Y_t = \phi Y_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t  |\phi| < 1
\varepsilon \sim \mbox{ N } (0,1) \mbox{ i.i.d. }
X_t = \theta u_{t-1} + u_{t}

u_t \sim \mbox{ N } (0,\sigma) \mbox{ i.i.d. }
Derive the variance of the forecast error for the optimal one-step and two-step forecasts of each of Y_t and X_t
One Step forecase of Y_t
\hat{Y}_{t+1,t}
Two Step forecast of Y_t
\hat{Y}_{t+2,t}
E_{t}[Y_{t_1}] = \phi Y_t

First Order Autocorrelation

Cov(Y_t,Y_{t-1}) =
\frac{\phi_1 \sigma^2}{1-\phi_2^2}
