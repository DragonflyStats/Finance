The ARCH model

\eta_{t+1}

142QF Section 4

 

Section 7 of Tsay

 

The time series \epsilon^2_{t+1} can be decomposed into two parts

1) The conditional mean

2) The innovation series \eta_{t+1}

\eta_{t+1}  \sim WN(0,\sigma^2)

\[ E(\eta_{t+1}) = 0\]

The autocorrelation function ACF of t+12 would be zero for all time lags.

The ARCH model


The GARCH model

\[ \sigma^2_{t+1} = \omega +\alpha \epsilon^2_t + \beta \sigma^2_t \]
