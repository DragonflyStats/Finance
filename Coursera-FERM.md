<strong><span style="font-size:1.285714286rem;line-height:1.6;">About the Part 1 Course</span></strong>
<div>Financial Engineering is a multidisciplinary field involving finance and economics, mathematics, statistics, engineering and computational methods.  The emphasis of <b>FE & RM</b> <b>Part I</b> will be on the use of simple stochastic models to price derivative securities in various asset classes including equities, fixed income, credit and mortgage-backed securities.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We will also consider the role that some of these asset classes played during the financial crisis. A notable feature of this course will be an interview module with <b>Emanuel Derman</b>, the renowned ``quant'' and best-selling author of "My Life as a Quant".We hope that students who complete the course and the follow-up course (<b>FE & RM</b> <b>Part II</b>) will have a good understanding of the "rocket science" behind financial engineering. But perhaps more importantly, we hope they will also understand the limitations of this theory in practice and why financial models should always be treated with a healthy degree of skepticism.</div>
