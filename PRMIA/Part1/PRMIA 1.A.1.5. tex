The Sharpe Ratio


There is a risk free asset returning the risk free rate r.



SR =- r


 represents the expected return of the portfolio

 is the standard deviation of the risk free return.

Kappa Index

Omega Index

The Omega Statistic is the ratio of expected returns above the threshold to the the expected return under the threshold.


(t) =E[max(R-),0]E[max(-R),0]

Kappa indices have the following properties

    1) They decrease monotonically with the choice of threshold .

Jensen's measure calculates the average return of a portfolio [Rp] over that calculated by the CAPM.


p=Rp-[Rf+[Rm-Rf]]


Rp=24%    Rf=6%    = 2.1    Rm= 14%

p= 24 - [6+ 1.2[14 -6]] =1.8

1.A.1.7    Kappa Indices


Semivariance of a risky asset is defined by the expected value of the squared deviation of returns below the expected returns.

 

The lower partial moment (LPM) order n (n>0) of a random return R ( given the threshold  ) is defined as

 

 


The Sortino Index is the second order index.

\section{Encoding a Utility Function}

\begin{itemize}
\item For an individual
\item For a firm
\item Ironing out anomalies
\end{itemize}

%====================================================%

\begin{itemize}
\item Drawing a utility function over various states of wealth for an entity

\item Risk Attitude can be inferred from a series of a decisions.
\item Problems submitted for decision are
\begin{itemize}
\item[i] Realistic
\item[ii] Meaningful
\item[iii] Clear and Simple
\end{itemize}
\item Define a monetary range of interest. This range should cover the personal impact of all decisions that person would make
\item Without loss of generality assign a utility score to possible outcomes
\end{itemize}

%=================================%
\subsection{For the firm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Encoding a utility function for a firm presents a much greater challenge.
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] Should thre be a single risk attitude for all decisions in the firm?
\item[$\bullet$] Whose risk attitude should be encoded?
\end{itemize}
\item  Firm's risk attitude to strategic decisions should be taken at board level. Then the risk policy should delegate downwards.
\end{itemize}
