--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Sinking Fund  (i)

A means of repaying funds that were borrowed through a bond issue. 

The issuer makes periodic payments to a trustee who retires part of the issue by purchasing the bonds in the open market.


Rather than the issuer repaying the entire principal of a bond issue on the maturity date,  another company buys back a portion of the issue annually and usually at a fixed par value or at the current market value of the bonds, whichever is less. Should interest rates decline following a bond issue, sinking-fund provisions allow a firm to lessen the interest rate risk of its bonds as it essentially replaces a portion of existing debt with lower-yielding bonds.


From the investor's point of view, a sinking fund adds safety to a corporate bond issue: with it, the issuing company is less likely to default on the repayment of the remaining principal upon maturity since the amount of the final repayment is substantially less. This added safety affects the interest rate at which the company is able to offer bonds in the marketplace.





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Foreign Bonds (k)


Alpine : 


Matador : A term used to identify a foreign bond issued in Spain by a company that is not domiciled in Spain. Matador bonds were bonds denominated in pesetas, and were usually corporate bonds. The market for matador bonds grew rapidly between 1987 and 1999, and attracted many large local and foreign investors. The name matador originated from the bullfighters in Spain.

Bulldog : A type of bond purchased by buyers interested in earning a revenue stream from the British pound or sterling. A bulldog bond is traded in the United Kingdom. If the revenue is used to reduce debt also in British pounds, the exchange rate risk is decreased. These bonds are issued by non-British institutions that want to sell the bond in the United Kingdom. U.S. investors can also purchase this bond, but by doing so they take on the risk of the change in value of the sterling.


Samurai : A yen-denominated bond issued in Tokyo by a non-Japanese company and subject to Japanese regulations. Other types of yen-denominated bonds are Euroyens issued in countries other than Japan.


Yankee : A bond denominated in U.S. dollars that is publicly issued in the U.S. by foreign banks and corporations. According to the Securities Act of 1933, these bonds must first be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before they can be sold. Yankee bonds are often issued in tranches and each offering can be as large as $1 billion.






--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(o) Underwriting  : The process by which investment bankers raise investment capital from investors on behalf of corporations and governments that are issuing securities (both equity and debt). 


 (p) Underwriter : A company or other entity that administers the public issuance and distribution of securities from a corporation or other issuing body. An underwriter works closely with the issuing body to determine the offering price of the securities, buys them from the issuer and sells them to investors via the underwriter's distribution network.


Underwriters generally receive underwriting fees from their issuing clients, but they also usually earn profits when selling the underwritten shares to investors. 

However, underwriters assume the responsibility of distributing a securities issue to the public. If they can't sell all of the securities at the specified offering price, they may be forced to sell the securities for less than they paid for them, or retain the securities themselves.


Book Runner : The main underwriter or lead manager in the issuance of new equity, debt or securities instruments. 

In investment banking, the book runner is the underwriting firm that "runs," or who is in charge, of the books. 


A large, leveraged buyout could involve multiple companies, and the book runner works with the other participating firms. Typically, one company takes the responsibility of "running" or handling the books, and the book runner is listed first among the other underwriters participating in the issuance. More than one book runner can manage a security issuance, in which case the involved parties are called "joint book runners."




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(r) Bought Deal : A new share issue that is bought entirely by one underwriter to resell to investors.


An underwriter will only do a bought deal if it is confident there is enough demand for the shares.



(u) Default rate: The rate at which debt holders default on the amount of money that they owe. 

It is often used by credit card companies when setting interest rates, but also refers to the rate at which corporations default on their loans. 

Default rates tend to rise during economic downturns, since investors and businesses see a decline in income and sales while still required to pay off the same amount of debt.
