A risk assessment technique often used to reduce the probability a portfolio will incur large losses. 
This is performed by assessing the likelihood (at a specific confidence level) that a specific loss will exceed the value at risk. 
Mathematically speaking, CVaR is derived by taking a weighted average between the value at risk and losses exceeding the value 
at risk.
