an FRA is an agreement between two parties

in which one party agrees to make a known interest payment to the other party at a future date with the seller agreeing to make an interest payment to the buyer based on an unknown rate that will be dtermined when the contract expires.


 most FRAs are basex on established interest rates such as the US rate or LIBOR.


The undeying asset is a Eurodollar time deposit.


notional principal

is never paid because it serves no purpose other to determine interest rate payments.


At the start of the contract the value of the FRA is zero because no money changes hands.
