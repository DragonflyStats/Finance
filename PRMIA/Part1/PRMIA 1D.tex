\section{PRMIA Section 1D}

CHAPTER 1 provides a general overview of risk and risk aversion, introduces the utility function and mean–
variance criteria. Various risk-adjusted performance measures are described. A summary of several widely used
utility functions is presented in the appendix.


\subsection{Risk and Risk Aversion - Learning Outcome Statement}
The candidate should be able to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Explain the concepts of Utility and Utility Maximization

\item Discuss the Mean-Variance Criterion
\item Define the Sharpe, Treynor and Information Ratios
\item Define Jenson’s Alpha, RAROC, RoVaR and RAPM
\item Define the Sortino, Omega Index and Kappa Ratios
\end{itemize}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------%
\section{The CAPM and 
Multifactor Models }
CHAPTER 4 provides a rigorous description of the CAPM model, including betas, systematic risk, alphas and
performance measures. Arbitrage pricing theory and multifactor models are also introduced in this chapter.
