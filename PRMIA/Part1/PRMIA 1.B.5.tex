%-----------------------------------------------%
\subsubsection{Butterfly Spread}
\begin{itemize}
\item  An option strategy that combines a bull and a bear spread. 
\item It uses three strike prices,
the lower two strike prices are used in the bull spread, and the higher strike price is used in the bear spread. Both puts and calls are used.
\itemThe strategy has limited risk, but limited profit.

\item Sell two calls and buying two calls on the same or different markets, with different maturity dates.

\item An investor will profit if the underlying security makes no dramatic movements because the premium income will be collected when the options are sold.
\end{itemize}
