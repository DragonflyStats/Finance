2.B.5.4 Negative Semi-Variance and Negative Semi-Deviation



Kurtosis
indicates peakedness of a distribution.
\begin{itemize}
\item Leptokurtic (sharp peaked)
\item Platykurtic (flat)
\item Mesokurtic (in between)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Coefficient of Kurtosis}
\[
\frac{\left[ \frac{\sum(x-\bar{X})^4}{n-1} \right]}{\left[ \sqrt{\frac{\sum(x-\bar{X})^2}{n-1}} \right]^4}
\]
derived by standardising the 4th moment about the mean by dividing by the standard deviation raised to the 4th power.
