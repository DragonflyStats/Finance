\subsection{Extreme Value Theory}

EVT is based on Limit Laws which apply to the extreme observations of a sample

These Laws allow parameter estimation of a high quantile of loss distribution without making any assumptions about the shape of the return distribution of the whole.

It must be assumed that the historical data employed in the estimation of the tail are representative, and the size of the historical data sample must be large enough to yield
enough tail observations to get good estimates

2 types of EVT used are
\begin{itemize}
\item[1)] Block Maxima
\item[2)] Peaks over Threshold
\end{itemize}
