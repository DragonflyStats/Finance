Conclusion


Investors typically utilize two approaches to measure default Risk

1) judge the financial characteristics of the securities and their issuers.

This is generally done by analysis the issuers financial statements, particularly financial ratios.

2) use credit ratings

	obtained from agencies such as Moody's and Standard and Poor.
The bond issuers pay the rating agency to evaluate the quality of their bond issue in order to increase the information flow, and hence increase demand for their bond.
The bond agencies determine the appropriate bond rating by assessing various factors.

The bond rating assigned to a bond issue directly affects its yield. The higher the rating, the lower the debt yield.
