3) Lack of transparency

4) Inadequate communication of information between levels of management

5) Inadequate or ineffective audit and compliance programmes

\subsection*{3.C.1.11. Conclusion}


This section discusses operational risk process models. By better understanding business processes we can find
the sources of risk and often take steps to re-engineer these processes for greater efficiency and lower risk.




Top-down approaches tend to be those an external analyst could use with public information. Armed with an income statement and market data, most of them (e.g., multi-factor model) can be performed by a third-party. Consequently, they are limited but easier to conduct.
Bottom-up approaches require an "inside job:" internal data, management interviews. Consequently, they are generally superior but more difficult (data intensive): they are diagnostic, predictive, and often revealing of causality. A key difference is that "top down" approaches do not differentiate between HFLS/LFHS losses but bottom-up approaches can indeed distinguish between HFLS/LFHS losses.

\subsection*{3.C.2.4. Advanced Models}
 
When ORM was in its infancy. There was two schools of thought. The first was that you can not manage what you can not measure.
The other school believed that operational Risk cannot be Quantified effectively, and they focussed on more humanistic qualitative approaches such as self assessment, riskmaps , and audit findings.

ama: adavanced measurement approach
3.C.3.1. The "Loss Model" approach
Operational Risk Matrix
 
ORC is held to cover all losses.
The ORC is thus defined using the VaR metrix, for some risk horizon and at some percentile.
The Basel Committee recommend 99.9% and 1 year.
 
The Frequency distribution

: expected loss frequency
N: expected total number of events during the risk horizon
p: expected loss probability
 
Poisson distribution
negative binomial distribution
Estimating the poisson frequency from historical data
The Severity distribution
 

Example
Assume the following operational process:

\begin{verbatim}
A Bernoulli distribution characterizes the frequency of losses. The probability of no operational loss = 95%: P(0) = 95%, P(1) = 5%

The loss severity is characterized by a PMF: P(-$50,000 loss) = 2%, P(-$30,000 loss) = 18%, P(-$10,000 loss) = 24%, and P(-$5,000 loss)  = 56%. 

(Note this is a discrete distribution where the outcomes are mutually exclusive and cumulatively exhaustive; however, a typical severity distribution is continuous)

99% Operational VaR = Unexpected loss = Loss @ 99% - Expected Loss (EL).

Start with the worst loss and works backwards:

\[ P(\$50,000 loss) = (5\%)(2\%) = 0.1\%\]
\[ P(\$30,000 loss) = (5\%)(18\%) = 0.9\%\]
Cumulatively, that is 1% (0.1% + 0.9% = 1.0%). So, the loss @ 99% is $30,000
The expected loss = 5% * [(2%)(50,000)+(18%)(30,000)+(24%)(10,000)+(56%)(5,000)] = $580

So, the 99% Operational VaR = $30,000 (loss @ 99%) - $580 = $29,420

Similarly, the 95% Operational VaR = $4,420

99% Operational VaR = Unexpected loss = Loss @ 99% - Expected Loss (EL).

Start with the worst loss and works backwards:

P($50,000 loss) = (5%)(2%) = 0.1%
P($30,000 loss) = (5%)(18%) = 0.9%
Cumulatively, that is 1% (0.1% + 0.9% = 1.0%). So, the loss @ 99% is $30,000
The expected loss = 5\% * [(2\%)(50,000)+(18%)(30,000)+(24%)(10,000)+(56%)(5,000)] = $580

So, the 99\% Operational VaR = $30,000 (loss @ 99%) - $580 = $29,420

Similarly, the 95\% Operational VaR = $4,420

VaR is not the worst loss

This is the operational LDA approach: a loss frequency distribution is compounded with a loss severity distribution (but a severity distribution is typically continuous, unlike my discrete example here)

I called the discrete severity a PMF versus a PDF per Gujarati definitions. Know the difference, please.
Just like with a credit portfolio, there is an expected loss (EL). The VaR is the unexpected loss: VaR = Loss @ 9x% - EL.
\end{verbatim}
If you look at the EditGrid below, the two distributions compound into a single PMF. Next to it, the running total is the CDF. Each discrete outcome in the PDF is simply the product of [Frequency][Severity]. Notice the analogy to credits where EL = PD * LGD. In operational terms, EL = PE (probability of event, frequency) * LGE (loss given event, severity). Finally, back to Gujarati, that's a joint probability.

\subsection{3.C.3.2. The Frequency Distribution}
Defined risk horizon

The Probability of a loss event can be translated into the loss frequency denoted lamb.
the product of the total number of events during tbe risk horizon
Loss frequency is a discrete random variable

Binomial frequency can only be used when a value for N is specified
 
Poisson Distribution


negative binomial distribution
 
b(n) =+n -1n11 +1 + 


Choosing the best functional form is not a main source of model risk
3.C.3.3. The Severity Distribution
 
Lognornmal distribution for loss severity L has the density function.
 
High frequency risks can have severity distributions that are relatively lognormal, but low frequency risks can have severity distributions that are too skewed and leptokurtic to be well
captured by the lognormal density function.
 
 
(.) denoted the gamma function 
B(.) denotes the Bessel function of the first kind.

\subsection{Extreme Value Theory}
 
It is debatable that fitting a generalized Pareto distribution tova sparse and fragmented data set yields anything useful
Peaks over Thresholds model applies when losses over a high and predefined threshold are record.

 The internal measurements approach
(IMA)
Gamma. expected annual loss
N is a volume indicator p is the expected number of losses gamma is a multiplier that depends on the operational risk type.
The loss distribution is binomially distributed and loss severity is not regarded as a random variable
standard deviation of annual loss.

Loss Distribution Approach ( LDA ) will always increase the ORC.
ORC is measured by a VaR metric and is either unexpected loss at percentile or the percentile itself depending on whether or not the expected losses were provisioned.
