\end{enumerate}

Risk adjusted return on capital (RAROC) is a risk-based profitability measurement framework for analysing risk-adjusted financial performance and providing a consistent view of profitability across businesses. 

Risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC) gives decision makers the ability to compare the returns on several different projects with varying risk levels.

RAROC was popularized by Bankers Trust in the 1980s as an adjustment to simple return on capital (ROC).

\subsection{3.0.1 Introduction}


\subsection{3.0.2 Economic Capital}
Economic capital is the amount of risk capital, assessed on a realistic basis, which a firm requires to cover the risks that it is running or collecting as a going concern, such as market risk, credit risk, and operational risk. It is the amount of money which is needed to secure survival in a worst case scenario.

\subsection{3.A.2.2. Definition of VaR}
Var is an estimate of the loss of a fixed set of trading positions that would be equalled or exceeded with a specified probability. 
 

It is never correct to consider VaR as a worst case scenario.
 
The use of VaR involves two arbitrarily chosen parameters - the holding period and the confidence level.

R is the  h-day returns are normally distributed with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$.

\textbf{\textit{Limitations}}:\\
1) Market value sensitivities often are not stables as the market conditions change.
2) Analytical VaR is particularly inappropriate if there are discontinuous payoffs in the portfolio.

\subsection{3.A.2.7 VaR of Equity Portfolio}

\[VaR= - ZXmk=1nkxkX\]

Stock market portfolios of 5 stocks

The value of the portfolio is $\$1$ million

Assume equal investment in each stock xkX= 0.2

Assume daily holding period

Stock market beta 
B= 0.7	A= 0.9 C= 0.5 D= 0.3 E= 0.1 (sum 2.5)

Confidence intervals 95%

VaR= 1.6451,000,0000.0250.22.5
\begin{verbatim}
VaR= $20,561
\end{verbatim} 
VaR Confidence and Time Horizons
It is usual to set a very high confidence level when estimating VaR for capital requirements.
 
For limit setting for managing day to day positions, it is usual to set VaR confidence levels that are neither too low to be exceed too often nor too high as to be never exceeded.

The time horizon may be a horizon roughly corresponding to a period in which positions may be liquidated in an orderly day, which could be just one day in a highly liquid market, or a week or more for larger positions in illiquid market.
 
\textbf{Sample Question 1}\\
For a security with a daily standard deviation of 2\%, calculate the 10-day Var at the 95\% confidence interval. Assume expected daily return to be nil.

If the daily standard deviation is 10\%, the 10 day standard deviation is 0.0210= 0.063245. 
The value of Z at the 95\% confidence level is 1.64485.
 
Therefore the Var value is 1.644850.063245 = 0.1040 , i.e 10.4\%.
Sample Question 2
 
If an institution has $\$1000$ in assets , and $\$800$ in liabilities, what is the economic capital required to avoid insolvency at 99\% level of confidence. The VaR in respect of the assets
at 99\% confidence over a one year period is $\$100$.
 
The economic capital required to avoid insolvenct is just the asset VaR i.e. $\$100$. This means that if the worst case losses are realized, the institution would need to have a buffer equivalent to those losses which in the this case will be $\$100$, and this buffer is the economic capital.
 
The actual value of the liabilities is not relevant as they are considered "riskless" from the instition's point of view, i.e. they will be taken at full value. in this particular case, the institution has $\$200$ in capital which is more than the economic required.
 
\textbf{Sample Question 3:} Cumulative accuracy plot
A cumulative accuracy plot measures the accuracy of credit ratings assigned by rating agencies by considering the relative ranking of obligors according to the ratings given.

\subsection*{3.A.3.4 Volatility Clustering}

Market shock is likely to be followed by a large return (in either direction) for some time.

By failing to take account of volatility clsutering a form would potentially take unduly large risks, or will hold insufficient capital, in periods of market crisis.

In addtion they would hold on to too much expensive capital at other times.
\begin{verbatim}
volatility can be incorporated into VaR using the "exponentially weighted moving average" (EWMA) approach.
GARCH models

Focuses ion volatility clustering
Addresses issues raised by heteroskedascity
All GARCH models share a positive correlation between risk yesterday and risk today (an "autoregressive" structure)

The simplest GARCH model consist of 2 equation which can be estimated together

%----------------------------------------------------%
\subsection{3.A.4.8 Algorithmic approaches to Stress testing}

Systematic approach to stress testing
The goal is to identify a search algorithm to identify the worst outcome for the portfolio within some defined feasible set

Factor push stress tests
This type of stress test is named because it involves "pushing" each individual market risk factor in the direction that results in a loss for the portfolio.

Factors
a push magntitude (M)
portfolio revaluation ( 1000 values computed, lower used)
each is repeated for each of the N market risks factors affecting the portfolio.

\textbf{Maximum Loss}://
a maximum loss scenario is defined as a set of changes in market risj factors that results in the losses, subject to some feasibility constraint on the allowable changes in market risk factors.
The constraint is necessary because the scenario requires some plausibility.

\subsection*{3.A.4.9. Extreme Value Theory as a Stress-tesing Methods}

EVT is based on limit laws which applies to extreme observations in a sample.
These laws allow parametric estimation of high quantiles of loss (negatie return) distributions without making any assumptios abut the shape of the return distrbution as a whole.

 \subsection{3.A.5 Liquidity Risk Management }
 Learning Outcome Statement
 The candidate should be able to:
 \begin{verbatim}
   Describe the factors which determine liquidity risks, and their pricing considerations
   Identify the processes concerning collateral management
   Discuss the implications of managing liquidity across business lines, legal entities, and currencies
   List the elements of funding diversification and market access

   Identify and differentiate the early warning signs of compromised liquidity
   Describe the components required for the disclosure of liquidity risk
   Identify, and design, the requirements of Stress Testing and a liquidity buffer
   Characterize the basic elements of financial contracts, their corresponding liquidity, and the relevance of time
   Describe the essential components of market, and funding, liquidity risk
   Discuss the impacts of counterparty / credit risk on liquidity relative to speads, defaults, credit enhancements, and asset based enhancements
   Describe the impact of behaviour on liquidity with respect to drawings, repayments, prepayments and draw-downs
   Derive the impact of insurance risk on liquidity
   Demonstrate the purpose, and effect of liquidity gap reports, and Liquidity at Risk (LAR)
   Describe the components of the contents used for internal and external liquidity reporting
  \end{verbatim}
  
 Liquidity risk is financial risk due to uncertain liquidity. An institution might lose liquidity if its credit rating falls, it experiences sudden unexpected cash outflows, or some other event causes counterparties to avoid trading with or lending to the institution. A firm is also exposed to liquidity risk if markets on which it depends are subject to loss of liquidity.
 
 Liquidity risk tends to compound other risks. If a trading organization has a position in an illiquid asset, its limited ability to liquidate that position at short notice will compound its market risk. Suppose a firm has offsetting cash flows with two different counterparties on a given day. If the counterparty that owes it a payment defaults, the firm will have to raise cash from other sources to make its payment. Should it be unable to do so, it too we default. Here, liquidity risk is compounding credit risk.
 
 Obviously, a position can be hedged against market risk but still entail liquidity risk. This is true in the above credit risk exampleâthe two payments are offsetting, so they entail credit risk but not market risk. Another example is the 1993 Metallgesellschaft Debacle. Futures were used to hedge an OTC obligation. It is debatable whether the hedge was effective from a market risk standpoint, but it was the liquidity crisis caused by staggering margin calls on the futures that forced Metallgesellschaft to unwind the positions.
 
  
 
    
 Accordingly, liquidity risk has to be managed in addition to market, credit and other risks. Because of its tendency to compound other risks, it is difficult or impossible to isolate liquidity risk. In all but the most simple of circumstances, comprehensive metrics of liquidity risk don't exist. Certain techniques of asset-liability management can be applied to assessing liquidity risk. A simple test for liquidity risk is to look at future net cash flows on a day-by-day basis. Any day that has a sizeable negative net cash flow is of concern. Such an analysis can be supplemented with stress testing. Look at net cash flows on a day-to-day basis assuming that an important counterparty defaults.
 
 Obviously, such analyses cannot take into account contingent cash flows, such as cash flows from derivatives or mortgage-backed securities. If an organization's cash flows are largely contingent, liquidity risk may be assessed using some form of scenario analysis. Construct multiple scenarios for market movements and defaults over a given period of time. Assess day-to-day cash flows under each scenario. Because balance sheets differed so significantly from one organization to the next, there is little standardization in how such analyses are implemented.
 
 Regulators are primarily concerned about systemic implications of liquidity risk.
