Nassim Taleb is a famous critic of the currently accepted VAR framework

Historical simulation is used to compute VaR.

The variance/covariance approach is not effective for measuring optins risk because it
does not take into account 2nd order curvature effects.

Sensitivity test deermine the effect of a single market risk factor whereas scenario
analysis determines the impact of multiple market risk factos on a portfolio.

Credit risk will be decreased with netting, more postions and counterparties.

Balance of payments is a factor for foreign currency rating.

KMV's EDF is a function of the firms capital structure, the volatility of the asset
returns and the current asset value.

ECAI: External Credit Assessment Institute.

EWMA and GARCH don assume constant volatitlity. They assume serial correaltion
is present in financial asset return series.

VAR analysis should be complemented by stress testing becasue stree testing identifies
low probability losses beyond the usual VaR measures. It does not
however provide a maximum loss.

Moody's rting measures over the life of a security.
1) the likelihood that the issuer will default on a security
2) the amount of the loss  after a default occurs.

Operational risk is any financial risk other than market and credit risk.

J.P. Morgan creditmetrics uses correlation of equity returns to estimate
defaul correlations.
Default Correlations can be estimated by rating changes.

International asset position is a critical element in assessing sovereign credit.

The KMV model uses the following to estimate the probability of default for a firm
- Stock Price volatility
- the market value of the firm's equity
- the book value of a firm's debt

According to the FSA, Operational Risk is the risk resulting form
    -human fallibility
    -Technology shortcomings
    -External factors

Equity price volatility is used to estimate the probability of defualt in the KMV model.

causal networks are very suitable for high frequency/low severity operational losses.
they explain losses in terms of a sequence of random variables.

The value of "Effective Maturity" for corporate exposures under the IRB foundation approach is 2.5 years.

Price controls is an indirec impact of sovereign risk on corporate rating.
Delta normal is appropriate for the fixed income work, unless it contains many mortgage backed securites.
