R(t) : Reliability function
  
Q(t) : Failure function
 
\lambda(t) : Failure rate
 
 
    R(t) = exp[-0t(s) ds]
     
 
E(t) : Mean time to Failure
 
E(t) =0R(t) dt
 
Mean time between failures (MTBF, 1/Î»)
 
Mean time between failures (MTBF) is the predicted elapsed time between inherent failures of a system during operation.
 
 
\[h(t) = \frac{f(t)}{R(t)} = \frac{\lambda e^{-t}}{e^{-t}}= \lambda\]
 
Time dependent logistic survival function
 
    (t) =exp(t+)1 + exp(t+)
