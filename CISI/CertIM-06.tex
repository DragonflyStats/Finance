\subsection{Fundamental Accounting Bases}

\begin{itemize}
\item Financial statements are drawn up under the historic cost convention - using
the actual price cost
\item In addition to this, there are five fundamental accouting principles.
\end{itemize}
%------------------%
\begin{enumerate}
\item The going concern concept - assumes that the company will continue to trade as a going concern for the
foreseeable future.

\item The accruals concept - This requires the accounts to reflect revenues and expenses
as they are earned and incurred, rather than when they are received and paid.

\item The prudence concept - while revenues and profits must not be anticipated, foreseeable costs and losses
must be provided for within the accounts.

\item The consistency concept - accounting treatments adopted in the accounts must
be consistently applied between accounting periods and between similar terms.

\item Non-aggregation (no netting off) - Individual assets and liabilities must be
accounted for separately, even if paired.

\end{enumerate}
