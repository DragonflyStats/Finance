tidyquant
===============================
tidyquant, version 0.3.0, is a pretty sizable release that includes a little bit for everyone, including new financial charting and moving average geoms for use with ggplot2, a new tq_get get option called "key.stats" for retrieving real-time stock information, and several nice integrations that improve the ease of scaling your analyses. 

If you are not already familiar with tidyquant, it integrates the best quantitative resources for collecting and analyzing quantitative data, xts, zoo, quantmod and TTR, with the tidyverse allowing for seamless interaction between each. Iâ€™ll briefly touch on some of the updates by going through some neat examples. The package is open source, and you can view the code on the tidyquant github page.
