CQF 2 : Risk and Return 
This unit deals with the classical portfolio theory of Markowitz, the Capital Asset Pricing Model, more recent developments of these theories, also option types and strategies.
 
* Simulations: The lognormal random walk, probability density functions.
* Risk and reward: Measuring return, expectation and standard deviation.
* Modern Portfolio Theory (Markowitz): Expected returns, variances and covariances, benefits of diversification, the opportunity set and the efficient frontier, the Sharpe ratio, and utility functions.
* Capital Asset Pricing Model: Single-index model, beta, diversification, optimal portfolios, the multiindexmodel.
* Value at risk: Profit and loss for simple portfolios, tails of distributions, Monte Carlo simulations and historical simulations, stress testing and worst-case scenarios. Portfolios of derivatives.
* Introducing futures, forwards and options: Simple contingent claims, definitions and uses.
* Review of option strategies: Building up special payoff structures using vanilla calls and puts, horizontal, vertical and diagonal spreads.
* Review of options as speculative investments: Taking a view, gearing, strategies that benefit from moves in the asset or in volatility.
* The binomial model: Up and down moves, delta hedging and self-financing replication, no arbitrage, a pricing model, risk-neutral probabilities.
* Martingale theory: Fundamental definitions, concepts, results and tools.
