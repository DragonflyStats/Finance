\subsection{Modern portfolio theory (MPT)}
Modern portfolio theory (MPT) is a theory of investment which attempts to maximize portfolio expected return for a given amount of portfolio risk, or equivalently minimize risk for a given level of expected return, by carefully choosing the proportions of various assets. 

Beta

= Covariance of the returns between the industry and the market/variance of the return on the market 

and 

coefficient of correlation = Covariance of returns between the industry and the market/standard deviation of the industry and the market 

we can relate beta to the coefficient of correlation as

Beta = [Coefficient of correlation x standard deviation of the industry]/ standard deviation of the market


Roll's critique
Roll's critique is a famous analysis of the validity of empirical tests of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).
