ACT Cert FMM Study Unit 1

Study unit 1 introduces the fundamental concepts of financial mathematics and modelling in four areas of interest rate mathematics.

1) modelling the values of a series of fixed or groing future cashflows
2) modelling the term structure of interest rates using no arbitrage relationships
3) selected topics in probability and statistical models.

A fixed interest security
A body such as an industrial company, a local authority, or the government of a country
may raise money by floating a loan on the stock exchange. In many instances such a loan
takes the form of a fixed interest security, which is issued in bonds of a stated nominal
amount. The characteristic feature of such a security in its simplest form is that the holder
of a bond will receive a lump sum of specified amount at some specified future time
together with a series of regular level interest payments until the repayment (or
redemption) of the lump sum.
The investor has an initial negative cashflow, a single known positive cashflow on the
specified future date, and a series of smaller known positive cashflows on a regular set of
specified future dates.
 
2.3 An index-linked security
With a conventional fixed interest security the interest payments are all of the same
amount. If inflationary pressures in the economy are not kept under control, the
purchasing power of a given sum of money diminishes with the passage of time,
significantly so when the rate of inflation is high. For this reason some investors are
attracted by a security for which the actual cash amount of interest payments and of the
final capital repayment are linked to an “index” which reflects the effects of inflation.
Here the initial negative cashflow is followed by a series of unknown positive cashflows
and a single larger unknown positive cashflow, all on specified dates. However, it is
known that the amounts of the future cashflows relate to the inflation index. Hence these
cashflows are said to be known in “real” terms.

Note that in practice the operation of an index-linked security will be such that the
cashflows do not relate to the inflation index at the time of payment, due to delays in
calculating the index. It is also possible that the need of the borrower (or perhaps the
investors) to know the amounts of the payments in advance may lead to the use of an
index from an earlier period.

2.4 Cash on deposit
If cash is placed on deposit, the investor can choose when to disinvest and will receive
interest additions during the period of investment. The interest additions will be subject to
regular change as determined by the investment provider. These additions may only be
known on a day-to-day basis. The amounts and timing of cashflows will therefore be
unknown.
